1: The overflow on the multiplier will not accurately calculate overflow for large positively signed numbers. The ambiguity between these numbers
and their unsigned counterparts causes errors in the way we use the High output for overflow calculation. 
	Specifically, any positive signed combination that will return a 32bit answer that is larger than the 16bit signed representation size (32767)
	will not register an overflow, even though the number cannot be accurately contained in 16bits.

We tried a few methods to fix this issue, but eventually ran out of time. The test script does not contain any combinations that would cause this
error, so that other values could be tested.
